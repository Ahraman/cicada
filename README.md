# Welcome to Cicada #

Cicada is a work-in-progress game development framework, written entirely from scratch.

## Planned features ##

Currently, the very first release of Cicada is in development, with the following features expected to be shipped right out-the-gates:

- __Window creation__, __destruction__ and __management__ exclusive to the __Windows operating system__, including __exclusive fullscreeen__ and __borderless__ windows. Other operating systems will be supported in the future.
- Wrappers for each of the common rendering graphics APIs like __OpenGL__, __Vulkan__ and __DirectX 12__. A common wrapper over all of them is planned for future releases.
